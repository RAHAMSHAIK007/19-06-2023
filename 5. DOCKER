CONTAINERS:
its same as a server/vm.
it will not have any operating system.
os will be on images.
(SERVER=AMI, CONTAINER=IMAGE)

DOCKER: 
Its an free & opensource tool.
used to create, run & deploy applications containers.
it is introduced on 2013 by solomenhykes & sebastian phal.
We used GO laguage to develope the docker.
here we write files on YAML.
before docker user faced lot of problems, but after docker there is no issues with the application.


CONTAINERIZATION:
Process of packing an application with its dependencies.
ex: PUBG

os level of virtualization.

VIRTUALIZATION:
able to create resouce with our hardware properties.

ARCHITECTURE & COMPONENTS:
client: it will interact with user
user gives commands and it will be executed by docker client

daemon: manages the docker components(images, containers, volumes)

host: where we install docker (ex: linux, windows, macos)

Registry: manages the images.

ARCHITECTURE OF DOCKER:
yum install docker -y    #client
systemctl start docker	 #client,Engine
systemctl status docker






COMMANDS:
docker pull ubuntu	: pull ubuntu image
docker images		: to see list of images
docker run -it --name cont1 ubuntu : to create a container
-it (interactive) - to go inside a container

apt update -y	: to update 
redhat=yum
ubuntu=apt
without update we cant install any pkg in ubuntu

apt install git -y
apt install apache2 -y
service apache2 start
service apache2 status

docker p q	: to exit container
docker ps -a	: to list all containers
